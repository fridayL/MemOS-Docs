### Environment Configuration

```python
import requests
import json
import os
import pickle
import time
from datetime import datetime
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, as_completed
from requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter
from urllib3.util.retry import Retry
import re
from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Any, Set, Tuple
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from enum import Enum
```

## Recipe 3.0: Text Preprocessing and API Environment Configuration

### 🎯 Goal

Establish structured processing foundation for novel text, including chapter segmentation and AI service connection.

### 📖 Chapter Segmentation Algorithm

Use regular expressions to identify chapter titles and split long novels into processable fragments:

```python
def extract_all_chapters(text: str, output_dir: str = "chapters"):
    # Match positions of all "Chapter X" titles
    pattern = r"(第[一二三四五六七八九十百千零〇两\d]+章)"
    matches = list(re.finditer(pattern, text))

    if not matches:
        raise ValueError("No chapter titles found")

    os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)

    for i in range(len(matches)):
        start_idx = matches[i].start()
        end_idx = matches[i+1].start() if i+1 < len(matches) else len(text)
        chapter_title = matches[i].group()
        chapter_number = i + 1  # Use natural numbers for numbering
  
        chapter_text = text[start_idx:end_idx].strip()
        filename = os.path.join(output_dir, f"chapter{chapter_number}.txt")
        with open(filename, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            f.write(chapter_text)
        print(f"✅ Saved: {filename} ({chapter_title})")

# Read the entire novel
with open("天龙八部.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    full_text = f.read()

# Extract and save all chapters
extract_all_chapters(full_text)
```

### 🔧 API Client Configuration

Establish stable AI service connections, supporting model calls for different task types:

```python
# JSON repair functionality configuration
try:
    from json_repair import repair_json
    HAS_JSONREPAIR = True
    print("✓ jsonrepair library loaded, JSON repair functionality enabled")
except ImportError:
    HAS_JSONREPAIR = False
    print("⚠ jsonrepair library not installed, will use basic repair strategy")
    def repair_json(text):
        return text

class TaskType(Enum):
    EVENT_EXTRACTION = "event_extraction"

class MemOSLLMClient:
    """Dialogue client - using MemOS makes AI calls simple and reliable"""
  
    def __init__(self, api_key: str, api_base: str = "https://api.openai.com/v1", model: str = "gpt-4o"):
        # 🔧 Step 1: Import MemOS intelligent components
        from memos.llms.factory import LLMFactory
        from memos.configs.llm import LLMConfigFactory
  
        # 🎯 Step 2: Tell MemOS which AI model we want to use
        llm_config_factory = LLMConfigFactory(
            backend="openai",  # Use OpenAI (also supports other vendors)
            config={
                "model_name_or_path": model,  # Your chosen AI model
                "api_key": api_key,          # Your API key
                "api_base": api_base,        # API service address
                "temperature": 0.8,          # Creativity level
                "max_tokens": 8192,          # Maximum response length
                "top_p": 0.9,               # Response quality control
            }
        )
  
        # 🚀 Step 3: Let MemOS help us create a dialogue client
        # MemOS will automatically handle complex issues like network retries and connection pools
        self.llm = LLMFactory.from_config(llm_config_factory)
        print(f"✅ Dialogue client ready! Using model: {model}")
  
    def call_api(self, messages: List[Dict], task_type: TaskType, timeout: int = 1800) -> Dict:
        """Method to chat with AI - it's that simple!"""
        try:
            response = self.llm.generate(messages)
            return {
                "status": "success",      # Success!
                "content": response,      # AI's answer
                "model_used": self.llm.config.model_name_or_path  # Which model was used
            }
        except Exception as e:
            # 😅 If there's an error, MemOS will tell us exactly what the problem is
            return {
                "status": "error", 
                "error": str(e),
                "model_used": self.llm.config.model_name_or_path
            }
```

### 🚀 Batch Processing Initialization

Establish chapter traversal mechanism, preparing for subsequent parallel processing:

```python
# 🎯 Configure your AI assistant (using MemOS makes everything simple)
API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"  # 🔑 Fill in your OpenAI API key
API_BASE = "https://api.openai.com/v1"  # 🌐 API service address (usually no need to change)
MODEL_NAME = "gpt-4o"  # 🤖 Choose your preferred AI model

# 🚀 Create your dedicated AI assistant
api_client = MemOSLLMClient(
    api_key=API_KEY,
    api_base=API_BASE,
    model=MODEL_NAME
)
# Now you have a smart, stable, easy-to-use AI assistant!

memcubes = {}  # Global character memory repository
alias_to_name = {}  # Alias to standard name mapping
chapter_folder = "chapters"

# Process in chapter order
chapter_files = sorted(
    [os.path.join(chapter_folder, f) for f in os.listdir(chapter_folder) 
     if f.startswith("chapter") and f.endswith(".txt")],
    key=lambda x: int(re.search(r'chapter(\d+)', x).group(1))
)

for chapter_file in chapter_files:
    chapter_id = chapter_file.replace(".txt", "")
    print(f"\n📖 Processing: {chapter_id}")
  
    with open(chapter_file, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        content = f.read()
    # Subsequent processing logic...
```

## Recipe 3.1: AI-Driven Character Recognition and Alias Unification

### 🎯 Goal

Use AI to automatically identify characters in novels, establish alias mapping relationships, and initialize character memory containers.

### 🧠 Intelligent Character Recognition

Implement accurate character extraction and alias merging through carefully designed prompts:

```python
@staticmethod
def extract_character_names_prompt(paragraph: str, alias_to_name: dict = None):
    system_msg = (
        "You are a novel character recognition expert. Please extract all explicitly mentioned characters from the following novel excerpt.\n"
        "For each character, please mark the character's standard name (such as \"Qiao Feng\") and all titles, aliases, and references that appear in this excerpt (such as \"Beggar Gang Leader\", \"Leader Qiao\", \"that big man\").\n\n"
        "Please return in the following JSON format:\n"
        "[\n"
        "  {\n"
        "    \"name\": \"Qiao Feng\",\n"
        "    \"aliases\": [\"Beggar Gang Leader\", \"Leader Qiao\", \"that big man\"]\n"
        "  }\n"
        "]\n\n"
        "⚠️ Note:\n"
        "1. Only include characters, not locations or organizations.\n"
        "2. Multiple titles of the same character should be unified in the same entry.\n"
        "3. Use standard JSON format for all fields. Do not include markdown symbols or comments.\n"
        "4. If you cannot determine whether a title refers to a new character, you may temporarily keep it as a separate entry."
    )

    if alias_to_name:
        system_msg += "\n\nThe following are known aliases corresponding to standard character names. Please try to categorize newly recognized titles under existing characters:\n"
        alias_map_str = json.dumps(alias_to_name, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2)
        system_msg += alias_map_str

    return [
        {"role": "system", "content": system_msg},
        {"role": "user", "content": f"Novel excerpt as follows:\n{paragraph}"}
    ]
```

### 💾 MemCube Initialization and Alias Management

Create structured memory containers for each identified character:

```python
def init_memcube(character_name: str, chunk_id: str):
    """Initialize character memory cube - contains all core fields"""
    return {
        "name": character_name,
        "first_appearance": chunk_id,
        "aliases": [character_name],
        "events": [],
        "utterances": [],
        "speech_style": "",
        "personality_traits": [],
        "emotion_state": "",
        "relations": []
    }

# Execute character recognition and initialization
name_prompt = Prompt.extract_character_names_prompt(content, alias_to_name)
name_result = api_client.call_api(name_prompt, TaskType.EVENT_EXTRACTION, timeout=1800)

try:
    extracted = json.loads(name_result.get("content", "").strip("```json").strip("```").strip())
except:
    extracted = []

# Update character repository and alias mapping
for item in extracted:
    std_name = item["name"]
    aliases = item.get("aliases", [])
  
    # Initialize or update MemCube
    if std_name not in memcubes:
        print(f"🆕 New character identified: {std_name}")
        memcubes[std_name] = init_memcube(std_name, chapter_id)
        memcubes[std_name]["aliases"] = []

    # Merge alias lists
    all_aliases = list(set(memcubes[std_name].get("aliases", []) + aliases))
    memcubes[std_name]["aliases"] = all_aliases

    # Build global alias mapping
    for alias in [std_name] + aliases:
        alias_to_name[alias] = std_name
```

## Recipe 3.2: Structured Memory Content Extraction

### 🎯 Goal

Use AI to extract structured character information from novel text, including events, quotes, personality, emotions, and relationship networks.

### 🎭 Multi-dimensional Information Extraction Prompt

Design precise prompt templates to ensure AI returns standardized JSON data:

```python
@staticmethod
def update_character_prompt(character_name: str, unfinished_events: list, paragraph: str):
    return [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": (
                "You are a novel character modeling expert who will analyze a character's unfinished events and the latest novel excerpt.\n"
                "Your task is to update the following fields:\n"
                "- events: Event list (update status, add new events, including subfields event_id, action, motivation, impact, involved_entities, time, location, event, if_completed)\n"
                "- Each event must include a unique \"event_id\", such as \"event_001\", \"event_002\", etc.\n"
                "- utterances: Things said (with time or event number)\n"
                "- speech_style: Speaking style (such as classical, direct, sarcastic, etc.)\n"
                "- personality_traits: Personality (such as calm, impulsive)\n"
                "- emotion_state: Current emotional state\n"
                "- relations: List of relationships with others\n\n"
                "Please pay special attention to the following requirements:\n"
                "1. Please carefully judge whether existing unfinished events have ended in the new excerpt.\n"
                "2. If an event has an ending or result, please mark its `if_completed` field as true.\n"
                "3. If new events related to this character appear in the novel excerpt, please add new event entries.\n"
                "Finally, please output the following JSON structure:\n"
                "{\n"
                "  \"events\": [...],\n"
                "  \"utterances\": [...],\n"
                "  \"speech_style\": \"...\",\n"
                "  \"personality_traits\": [...],\n"
                "  \"emotion_state\": \"...\",\n"
                "  \"relations\": [...]\n"
                "}\n\n"
                "⚠️ Please note:\n"
                "1. All field names must be wrapped in double quotes (JSON standard format).\n"
                "2. Do not add comment symbols, additional explanations, or markdown symbols.\n"
                "3. Only return complete JSON object, cannot be array or other formats.\n"
                "4. If there is no content to fill, please use empty array [] or empty string \"\".\n"
            )
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": (
                f"Character name: {character_name}\n"
                f"Current unfinished events as follows (JSON):\n{json.dumps(unfinished_events, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2)}\n\n"
                f"Novel excerpt as follows:\n{paragraph}\n\n"
                "Please return the character's updated information in the above format."
            )
        }
    ]
```

### 🔄 Intelligent Data Merging Algorithm

Implement event state tracking and incremental update mechanisms:

```python
def get_unfinished_events(memcube: dict):
    """Get list of unfinished events - for context continuity"""
    return [event for event in memcube.get("events", []) if not event.get("if_completed", False)]

def merge_events(old_events: list, new_events: list):
    """Intelligent event merging - handle status updates and new events"""
    event_dict = {e["event_id"]: e for e in old_events}

    for new_event in new_events:
        eid = new_event["event_id"]
        if eid in event_dict:
            # Merge strategy: new fields take priority, preserve historical information
            merged = event_dict[eid].copy()
            for key, value in new_event.items():
                if value not in [None, "", []]:
                    merged[key] = value
            event_dict[eid] = merged
        else:
            event_dict[eid] = new_event  # New events directly added

    return list(event_dict.values())

def merge_unique_list(old: list, new: list):
    """List deduplication merging - maintain original order"""
    combined = old + new
    seen = set()
    result = []
    for item in combined:
        if isinstance(item, dict):
            key = json.dumps(item, sort_keys=True, ensure_ascii=False)
        else:
            key = str(item)
        if key not in seen:
            seen.add(key)
            result.append(item)
    return result
```

### ⚡ Parallel Processing Engine

Use thread pools to implement efficient batch character updates:

```python
# Parallel update of all character states
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=8) as executor:
    futures = {
        executor.submit(update_memcube_for_character, name, memcube, content, chapter_id): name
        for name, memcube in memcubes.items()
    }

    for future in as_completed(futures):
        name = futures[future]
        try:
            name, updated, error = future.result()
            if error or not updated:
                print(f"⚠️ Update failed: {name} in {chapter_id} -> {error}")
                continue

            # Intelligently merge update results
            memcube = memcubes[name]
            memcube["events"] = merge_events(memcube["events"], updated.get("events", []))
            memcube["utterances"].extend(updated.get("utterances", []))
            if updated.get("speech_style"):
                memcube["speech_style"] = updated["speech_style"]
            memcube["personality_traits"] = merge_unique_list(
                memcube["personality_traits"], updated.get("personality_traits", [])
            )
            if updated.get("emotion_state"):
                memcube["emotion_state"] = updated["emotion_state"]
            memcube["relations"].extend(updated.get("relations", []))

        except Exception as e:
            print(f"⚠️ Parallel execution exception: {name} -> {e}")
```

## Recipe 3.3: Memory-Based Intelligent Reasoning System

### 🎯 Goal

Implement advanced functions such as novel plot reasoning, rationality assessment, and emotional analysis based on the constructed MemCube.

### 🔮 Plot Deduction Engine

Use complete character memory information for story development prediction:

```python
@staticmethod
def speculate_event_outcome(character_name: str, memcube: dict, user_input: str):
    """Plot deduction based on character memory - generate novel-style narration"""
    return [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": (
                "You are a novel script deduction expert.\n"
                "You will receive complete JSON information of all characters (including event chains, personality, emotions, relationships, etc.) and a hypothetical plot proposed by the user.\n"
                "Your task is to reasonably deduce possible story developments based on these characters' backgrounds, unfinished events, relationship networks, personality and motivations.\n"
                "Please generate complete novel paragraph-style narration (not list, not JSON), describing how the story unfolds.\n"
                "Note that the language style should be consistent with the original novel (such as classical martial arts style)."
            )
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": (
                f"Character name: {character_name}\n\n"
                f"Character information as follows (JSON format):\n{json.dumps(memcube, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2)}\n\n"
                f"User's hypothetical plot as follows:\n{user_input}\n\n"
                "Please deduce the story development based on the above information, return novel-style language narration, do not include any explanatory language or JSON."
            )
        }
    ]

@staticmethod
def evaluate_plot_reasonableness(character_name: str, memcube: dict, user_input: str):
    """Plot rationality analysis - judge plot credibility based on character logic"""
    return [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": (
                "You are a novel character behavior rationality analysis expert.\n"
                "You will receive complete JSON information of all characters (including event chains, personality, emotions, relationships, etc.) and a hypothetical plot proposed by the user.\n"
                "Your task is:\n"
                "1. Judge whether this plot conforms to the character's behavioral logic, personality traits, emotional state, and current background.\n"
                "2. If unreasonable, please point out specific unreasonable aspects and explain the reasons.\n"
                "3. If reasonable, please explain its rationality and briefly describe how this plot naturally occurs.\n\n"
                "Return format:\n"
                "- Rationality assessment: Reasonable / Unreasonable / Conditionally reasonable\n"
                "- Analysis explanation: Detailed explanation of whether it conforms to character motivation, relationships and background\n"
                "- Suggestions: If necessary, provide modification suggestions or more reasonable alternative expressions\n\n"
                "Please answer in concise Chinese, do not generate novel text or JSON structure."
            )
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": (
                f"Character name: {character_name}\n\n"
                f"Complete information of all characters as follows (JSON format):\n{json.dumps(memcube, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2)}\n\n"
                f"User's plot conception as follows:\n{user_input}\n\n"
                "Please judge whether this plot conforms to the character's current state and logic, and explain the reasons."
            )
        }
    ]
```

### 🎭 Multi-dimensional Analysis Framework

Provide professional analysis tools such as emotional trajectory, conflict progression, and stance judgment:

```python
@staticmethod
def emotion_trajectory_prompt(character_name: str, memcube: dict, user_input: str):
    """Emotional trajectory analysis - predict character emotional changes"""
    return [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": (

## Recipe 3.4: Embedding Model Optimization Configuration

### 🔄 Embedding Model Switching for Chinese Text Retrieval

**Reason for Switching:**

The original code uses the nomic-embed model for text vectorization, but this model is primarily optimized for English text and has the following issues when processing Chinese novel content:

1. **Limited Chinese semantic understanding**: The nomic-embed-text model is mainly trained on English corpora, with weak semantic understanding and text relationship capture capabilities for Chinese language
2. **Insufficient retrieval accuracy**: In Chinese novels like "Demigods and Semi-Devils", semantic similarity calculations for character, event, and relationship retrieval are not accurate enough
3. **Missing cultural background**: Cannot well understand specific contexts such as martial arts, history, and culture in Chinese literary works

**Recommended Replacement Solutions:**

According to [Mem0 official documentation](https://docs.mem0.ai/components/embedders/models/openai) and [Chinese embedding model evaluation](https://github.com/wangyuxinwhy/uniem), the following configurations are recommended:

#### Option 1: OpenAI Embedding (Recommended)

```python
config = {
    "embedder": {
        "provider": "openai",
        "config": {
            "model": "text-embedding-3-large",  # Supports multiple languages, excellent Chinese performance
            "embedding_dims": 3072,
            "api_key": "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
        }
    }
}
```

**Advantages:**

- Supports Chinese and English bilingual, excellent performance in Chinese text retrieval tasks
- Higher vector dimensions (3072), richer semantic representation
- Good performance in MTEB-zh evaluation

#### Option 2: M3E Model (Open Source Alternative)

```python
config = {
    "embedder": {
        "provider": "huggingface",  
        "config": {
            "model": "moka-ai/m3e-base",  # Open source model specifically optimized for Chinese
            "embedding_dims": 768
        }
    }
}
```

**Advantages:**

- Specifically trained for Chinese, superior to OpenAI ada-002 in Chinese text classification and retrieval
- Supports heterogeneous text retrieval, suitable for novel character relationships and event retrieval
- Completely open source, no API call fees

#### Option 3: Local Deployment

```python
config = {
    "embedder": {
        "provider": "ollama",
        "config": {
            "model": "moka-ai/m3e-base",
            "ollama_base_url": "http://localhost:11434"
        }
    }
}
```

**Performance Comparison Data:**

According to [MTEB-zh evaluation](https://github.com/wangyuxinwhy/uniem) results:

| Model | Chinese Text Classification Accuracy | Chinese Retrieval ndcg@10 | Advantage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| nomic-embed | Not tested | Not tested | English optimization |
| OpenAI text-embedding-3-large | 0.6231 | 0.7786+ | Multilingual support |
| M3E-base | 0.6157 | 0.8004 | Chinese specialization |

## Recipe 3.5: Memory Graph Structure Transformer

### 🎯 Goal

Convert MemCube data to MemOS-compatible Memory node format, building a queryable knowledge graph.

### 🏗️ Memory Node Generation

Convert character events and relationships to standardized Memory objects:

```python
def create_memory_node(content: str, entities: list, key: str, memory_type: str = "fact") -> dict:
    """Create standardized Memory node"""
    node_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    now = datetime.now().isoformat()
  
    # Simulate embedding (in real applications, should use actual embedding service)
    embedding = [0.1] * 768  # Example dimension
  
    return {
        "id": node_id,
        "memory": content,
        "metadata": {
            "user_id": "",
            "session_id": "",
            "status": "activated",
            "type": "fact",
            "confidence": 0.99,
            "entities": entities,
            "tags": ["Event"] if "Event" in key else ["Relationship"],
            "updated_at": now,
            "memory_type": memory_type,
            "key": key,
            "sources": [],
            "embedding": embedding,
            "created_at": now,
            "usage": [],
            "background": ""
        }
    }
```

### 🔄 Batch Conversion Processing

Implement efficient MemCube to Memory conversion pipeline:

```python
INPUT_FILE = "memcube_all.json"
OUTPUT_FILE = "memory_graph.json"

with open(INPUT_FILE, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    memcube_data = json.load(f)

nodes = []
edges = []

for character, data in memcube_data.items():
    previous_event_id = None

    # === Event sequence conversion ===
    for event in data.get("events", []):
        memory_text = f"{character} at {event.get('time')} in {event.get('location')}, because of {event.get('motivation')}, performed {event.get('action')}, the result was {event.get('impact')}."
        entities = [character] + event.get("involved_entities", [])
        node = create_memory_node(
            content=memory_text,
            entities=entities,
            key=f"{character}'s event: {event.get('action')}"
        )
        nodes.append(node)

        # Establish event temporal relationships
        if previous_event_id:
            edges.append({
                "source": previous_event_id,
                "target": node["id"],
                "type": "FOLLOWS"
            })
        previous_event_id = node["id"]

    # === Relationship network aggregation ===
    relations_texts = []
    seen = set()
    for relation in data.get("relations", []):
        name = relation.get("name") or relation.get("人物") or relation.get("character")
        relation_text = relation.get("relation") or relation.get("relationship") or relation.get("关系")
        if not name or not relation_text:
            continue
        dedup_key = (str(name), str(relation_text))
        if dedup_key in seen:
            continue
        seen.add(dedup_key)
        relations_texts.append(f"has {relation_text} relationship with {name}")

    if relations_texts:
        memory_text = f"{character} " + ", ".join(relations_texts) + "."
        entities = [character] 
        node = create_memory_node(
            content=memory_text,
            entities=entities,
            key=f"{character}'s relationship summary",
        )
        nodes.append(node)

# Save conversion results
with open(OUTPUT_FILE, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    json.dump({
        "nodes": nodes,
        "edges": edges
    }, f, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2)

print(f"✅ Conversion completed, generated {len(nodes)} memory nodes, {len(edges)} edges")
print(f"📁 Output file: {OUTPUT_FILE}")
```

## Recipe 3.5: MemOS Integration and Query Validation

### 🎯 Goal

Integrate converted Memory data into MemOS system, implementing semantic-based intelligent retrieval.

### 🔗 MemOS Connector

Establish stable connection with MemOS service:

```python
import memos
from memos.configs.embedder import EmbedderConfigFactory
from memos.configs.memory import TreeTextMemoryConfig
from memos.configs.mem_reader import SimpleStructMemReaderConfig
from memos.embedders.factory import EmbedderFactory
from memos.mem_reader.simple_struct import SimpleStructMemReader
from memos.memories.textual.tree import TreeTextMemory
from memos.configs.mem_os import MOSConfig

# Load MemOS configuration
config = TreeTextMemoryConfig.from_json_file("/root/Test/memos_config.json")
tree_memory = TreeTextMemory(config)

# Load memory data
tree_memory.load("/root/Test")

# Execute semantic search
results = tree_memory.search("Duan Yu's first encounter with the fairy sister", top_k=5)

for result in results:
    relativity = result.metadata.relativity if hasattr(result.metadata, 'relativity') else 0.0
    print(f"Relevance: {relativity:.3f}")
    print(f"Content: {result.memory}")
    print("---")
```

### 🔍 Intelligent Retrieval Validation

Validate system performance through multi-dimensional queries:

```python
# Multi-type query testing
test_queries = [
    "Duan Yu's first encounter with the fairy sister",
    "Qiao Feng's identity mystery",
    "Xu Zhu's adventure experiences",
    "The grudge between Ding Chunqiu and Wu Yazi"
]

for query in test_queries:
    print(f"\n🔍 Query: {query}")
    results = tree_memory.search(query, top_k=3)
  
    for i, result in enumerate(results, 1):
        relativity = result.metadata.relativity if hasattr(result.metadata, 'relativity') else 0.0
        print(f"  {i}. Relevance: {relativity:.3f}")
        print(f"     Content: {result.memory[:100]}...")
```

## 🎯 Creative Extensions Based on MemOS

Congratulations! You have mastered the core technologies of MemOS. Now let's see what exciting applications we can create:

### 🕰️ Creative 1: Intelligent World Timeline System

Build a dynamic martial arts world timeline based on MemOS, letting AI understand causal relationships between events:

```python
# Example: Intelligent timeline management
timeline_memory = {
    "1094": {
        "events": ["Xiao Feng's identity mystery revealed", "Battle at Juxian Manor"],
        "consequences": ["Martial world shaken", "Beggar Gang split"],
        "affected_characters": ["Xiao Feng", "A'Zhu", "Duan Zhengchun"]
    },
    "1095": {
        "events": ["Truth of Yanmen Pass incident", "A'Zhu's death"],
        "consequences": ["Xiao Feng's mindset transformation", "Song-Liao tension"]
    }
}

# AI can answer: What would happen if Xiao Feng didn't go to Yanmen Pass?
```

### 🧠 Creative 2: Dynamic Working Memory World Background

Use MemCube's working memory functionality to update world background in real-time as the plot develops:

```python
# Example: Dynamic world state management
from memos.memories.textual.base import TextualMemoryItem

# Create world state memory items
world_state_memories = [
    TextualMemoryItem(
        memory="Song-Liao political tension reaches 0.8 level, border conflicts frequent",
        metadata={"type": "world_state", "category": "politics"}
    ),
    TextualMemoryItem(
        memory="Current legendary martial arts in jianghu: Nine Yang Divine Skill, Muscle-Tendon Changing Classic",
        metadata={"type": "world_state", "category": "martial_arts"}
    ),
    TextualMemoryItem(
        memory="Shaolin and Wudang maintain neutrality, Beggar Gang has internal split",
        metadata={"type": "world_state", "category": "sect_relations"}
    )
]

# Use MemCube's text memory to manage world state
mem_cube.text_mem.replace_working_memory(world_state_memories)

# When Xiao Feng makes important decisions, automatically update working memory
current_working_memory = mem_cube.text_mem.get_working_memory()
```

AI:    At that time, Xiao Feng was investigating his identity mystery in the Luoyang area, you encountered him in an inn...
       Xiao Feng looked at you, a young man, and asked: "Little brother, what are you doing out so late?"

Player: I tell him I want to learn martial arts and ask him to take me as disciple
AI:    Xiao Feng laughed heartily: "My own identity is a mystery, how can I be qualified to be a teacher?
       But since we met, it's fate. I can teach you a few moves for self-defense..."
       [Your martial arts level +1, relationship with Xiao Feng +5]

Player: I want to tell Xiao Feng the truth about his identity
AI:    This is a dangerous choice! Revealing identity prematurely might change the entire story direction...
       Are you sure you want to do this? This will open a completely new plot branch.
