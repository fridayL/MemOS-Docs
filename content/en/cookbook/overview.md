title: MemOS Scenario Examples

## Introduction

### Cookbook Philosophy: Problem-Oriented Approach

Welcome to the MemOS Cookbook! This is not a traditional technical documentation, but a hands-on guide focused on **solving real problems**.

**Why do we need this Cookbook?**

In AI application development, we often encounter these challenges:

- ü§î "How can I make my AI application remember user preferences?"
- üîç "How can I quickly retrieve relevant information from a large number of documents?"
- üí° "How can I build an intelligent assistant with long-term memory?"

Traditional documentation tells you **what it is**, API references tell you **how to call it**, while this Cookbook focuses on telling you **how to solve specific problems**.

**Core Philosophy of this Cookbook:**

1. **Problem-Driven**: Each recipe starts from a real use case scenario
2. **Practice-Oriented**: Provides complete code examples that can be run directly
3. **Progressive Learning**: From simple to complex, step by step
4. **Best Practices**: Incorporates experience and recommendations from production environments
