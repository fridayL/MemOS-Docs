title: Using MemOS to Build a Production-Grade Knowledge Q&A System
---
## **Preamble**

When building domain-specific Knowledge Q&A (QA) systems, the industry faces a common challenge: although Large Language Models (LLMs) have broad knowledge, they still lack precision and reliability in specialized domains; while traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods, although capable of introducing external knowledge, are limited by the discrete nature of documents and a lack of deep logical connections, making it difficult to handle complex reasoning-based questions.

The purpose of this chapter is to provide a demonstration of how to solve this problem based on MemOS, and to propose and implement a complete, production-grade knowledge enhancement solution demo. Our core objective is to prove and realize a key assertion: through a structured knowledge system, a carefully enhanced small-sized model can surpass the professional capabilities of a large model without enhancement.

To achieve this goal, we have designed and built a dynamic knowledge system called MemCube. Its construction process follows a rigorous engineering methodology:

**Mining and Structuring Implicit Knowledge**: We first systematically mine the implicit knowledge about a specific domain within a Large Language Model (LLM), and transform it into a large-scale, high-coverage explicit concept relationship graph through the method of "iterative concept graph augmentation".

**Generating Structured Knowledge Pairs**: Subsequently, using this concept graph as a guide, we again leverage the LLM to generate a large number of high-quality, Question-Answering (QA) knowledge pairs containing complex clinical logic, serving as the core content of the knowledge base.

**Building and Deploying the Knowledge Base**: Finally, we organize and load these QA knowledge pairs into a graph database (Neo4j) to form a dynamic knowledge base (MemCube) that can be efficiently retrieved by the MemOS system, thereby enhancing the domain capabilities of the small model.

This chapter will use a case study in the field of cardiovascular medicine to fully demonstrate the entire process of building MemCube from scratch, and through quantitative evaluation, validate the system's significant effect in enhancing the model's professional Q&A capabilities, providing a reusable standard process for implementing low-cost, high-precision, and explainable AI knowledge services in practical business.

## **Chapter Introduction: A Blueprint for Building a Dynamic Knowledge System**

The core research objective of this chapter is to verify that by systematically building a MemOS knowledge base (i.e., MemCube), a model with a relatively small parameter scale (e.g., 7B level) can achieve or even surpass the performance level of a large model (e.g., 32B+ level) in domain-specific Q&A performance.

This chapter will guide you through a complete knowledge engineering practice. Our ultimate goal is to build an intelligent Q&A system dedicated to the field of cardiology. To achieve this, we will follow a clear, phased path, with each step building upon the output of the previous one.

The overall outline of this chapter is as follows:

### **Phase One: Building the Foundational Structure of Domain Knowledge—Concept Graph Augmentation**

This is the foundation of all work. A high-quality knowledge base begins with a comprehensive and structured domain concept network, which is an explicit representation of the domain's implicit knowledge.

**Objective**: To create a large-scale graph that broadly covers the core concepts and their interrelationships in the field of cardiology.

**Acquiring Seed Concepts**: We filter materials from the cardiovascular domain from a professional medical dataset and use an LLM to preliminarily extract a batch of high-quality "seed concepts" as the starting point for the graph.

**Iterative Augmentation**: Based on the seed concepts, we use a multi-round automated process to have the LLM associate based on existing concepts in the graph, continuously generating new related concepts and establishing connections.

**Convergence and Evaluation**: We will introduce strict convergence control mechanisms (such as merging similar nodes, monitoring the growth rate of new concepts) to ensure the graph stops growing after reaching sufficient knowledge coverage. Finally, we will quantitatively evaluate the completeness of our graph by comparing it with keywords from external knowledge sources.

### **Phase Two: Generating Applicable Knowledge Content—Generating QA Pairs Based on the Graph**

With the concept graph as the foundational structure, we next need to populate it with specific knowledge that can be directly understood and utilized by AI, namely, question-answer pairs.

**Objective**: To transform the abstract concepts and relationships in the graph into a large number of specific QA pairs containing clinical logic.

**Single-Concept Knowledge Generation**: Traverse each core concept node in the graph and use an LLM to generate independent, in-depth clinical questions and answers for each concept.

**Relational Knowledge Generation**: For "concept pairs" that are connected in the graph, we have the LLM generate more complex, relational questions that reflect the intrinsic logic between them.

### **Phase Three: Assembling and Deploying the Knowledge Base—Constructing and Mounting MemCube**

Discrete QA data needs to be organized into an efficient system.

**Objective**: To structure all generated QA data and load it into a graph database, forming a knowledge base that can be called by MemOS at any time.

**Process**:

**Data Formatting**: We will unify all QA pairs into a standard JSON format and generate vector embeddings for the question texts to be used for retrieval.

**Graph Database Import**: Write scripts to batch and efficiently import the formatted node (concept, QA) and edge (relationship) data into a Neo4j database.

**MemOS Mounting**: Finally, through simple configuration, we will point the MemOS system to this Neo4j database, officially activating our cardiovascular MemCube.

### **Phase Four: Validating the Final Outcome—System Evaluation**

After construction is complete, we need to prove its value with objective data.

**Objective**: To quantitatively evaluate whether a smaller large model equipped with MemCube has surpassed an un-enhanced large model in professional Q&A capabilities.

**Process**: We will build an independent evaluation set and, through automated scripts, conduct a "same-question competition" for models with different configurations. A more powerful model will act as a referee for scoring, and finally, we will use win rates and scores to demonstrate the actual effectiveness of our system.

Through the above four phases, you will clearly see how an abstract business requirement is progressively implemented into a powerful, evaluatable AI knowledge system through a rigorous engineering methodology.

## **Construction and Augmentation of the Domain Concept Graph**

### **Objective**

To transform unstructured knowledge from a specific domain into a high-quality, structured set of seed concepts, which is the cornerstone for building an intelligent MemCube.

### **Core Philosophy**

In professional Q&A scenarios, the training data of Large Language Models (LLMs) already contains a massive amount of implicit domain knowledge. The challenge lies in how to systematically "extract" and "organize" this knowledge, thereby enabling a domain-specific, small-scale MemCube to possess knowledge capabilities comparable to those of a large model.

Directly asking an LLM "Please provide all knowledge in the cardiovascular field" is inefficient and infeasible. Therefore, we must establish a series of precise **"concept anchors"** and, based on these, systematically outline the knowledge graph of the domain within the LLM. Although the coverage of domain knowledge is difficult to quantify directly, we can indirectly measure it by the completeness of core concepts and keywords within the domain. The ultimate goal of this step is to capture domain concepts as comprehensively as possible to provide structured support for subsequent knowledge extraction.

### **Step 1: Seed Concept Acquisition**

The construction of the graph begins with acquiring a batch of high-quality "seed concepts." These initial concepts are the starting point for the iterative augmentation of the graph, and their quality directly affects the speed and efficiency of the model in building the domain knowledge framework.

To ensure the professionalism and coverage of the seed concepts, this experiment uses the public medical expert question dataset `medxpert` as the initial data source. This dataset contains clear medical domain classifications, making it convenient for us to accurately filter knowledge related to the cardiovascular field.

We define the following environment variables:

```python
# api url; the api key is your specific setting
# For the specific LLM models used:
# 1. In the stage of summarizing and inducing seed concepts, we use a powerful model MEDXPERT_THINKER=o3 to augment the existing 100+ questions in the medxpert cardiovascular domain and extract its thought process for analyzing the problems. Our purpose is not to have o3 answer each question correctly, but rather, after it thinks through and analyzes each cardiovascular problem, to summarize cardiovascular seed concepts from its thought process.
# 2. After extracting o3's thought process, we use MEDXPERT_THINK_EXTRACTOR=gpt-4o to extract cardiovascular concept nouns from its thought process to serve as seed concepts.
# For the two steps above, our purpose is to build a seed concept library; if you have your own proprietary domain document library, you can feel free to skip this stage and directly extract the seed concepts you are interested in from your domain documents.
# 3. After the seed concept library is established, we will proceed with domain concept graph augmentation. For this step, we recommend that you choose your model based on our experimental results and your cost budget as appropriate. In our experimental phase, we use CONCEPT_GRAPH_EXTENDER=gpt-4omini as a reference.
# 4. After the domain concept graph is completely built, we will perform separate QA generation for (a) each concept and (b) each meaningful concept pair. Since QA generation depends on the model's capabilities, we recommend you use a powerful model. In our experimental phase, we use QA_SYNTHESIZER=gpt-4o as a reference.
# For all embedding models used, we apply the open-source English embedding model EMBEDDING_MODEL=nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5

heart_data = []
for i in range(len(data)):
    if data[i]['body_system']=='Cardiovascular':
        heart_data.append(data[i])  
```

To enable stable and efficient interaction with large-scale language model APIs, we built a modular API client. This client integrates a connection pool, an automatic retry mechanism based on exponential backoff, and request timeout control, ensuring robustness under high concurrency. We also defined a standardized data structure (`AnalysisResult`) to uniformly store request results for easy subsequent processing.

```python

@dataclass
class AnalysisResult:
    """class for analyzing the result"""
    status: str  # success, api_error
    question_id: str
    input_data: Dict
    response: Optional[str] = None
    error_details: Optional[str] = None
    processing_time: Optional[float] = None

class APIClient:
    """class for api calling"""

    def __init__(self, api_url: str, api_key: str, model_name: str):
        self.api_url = api_url
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.model_name = model_name

        # Create a session and configure the connection pool and retry strategy
        self.session = requests.Session()

        retry_strategy = Retry(
            total=3,
            backoff_factor=1,
            status_forcelist=[500, 502, 503, 504],
        )

        adapter = HTTPAdapter(pool_connections=10, pool_maxsize=20, max_retries=retry_strategy)
        self.session.mount('http://', adapter)
        self.session.mount('https://', adapter)

        self.session.headers.update({
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {self.api_key}"
        })

    def call_api(self, messages: List[Dict], timeout: int = 120) -> Dict:
        """call api"""
        data = {
            "model": self.model_name,
            "messages": messages,
            "stream": False
        }

        try:
            response = self.session.post(url=self.api_url, json=data, timeout=timeout)
            response.raise_for_status()
            result = response.json()
            return {
                "status": "success",
                "content": result['choices'][0]['message']['content']
            }
        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            return {
                "status": "error",
                "error": str(e)
            }
  
```

We encapsulate and generate instructions for interacting with the LLM through a carefully designed `PromptTemplate` class. This template sets the role of the LLM as a senior professor of clinical medicine and requires it to systematically deconstruct and analyze medical problems in a structured manner. Such structured output is the key to the precise extraction of information in subsequent steps.

```python

class PromptTemplate:

    @staticmethod
    def get_system_prompt() -> str:
        return """You are a world-renowned clinical professor at a top teaching hospital with over 20 years of experience. Your thinking is grounded in evidence-based medicine, characterized by rigorous logic and clear reasoning.

Your core mission extends beyond solving clinical problems—you must **teach young doctors and medical students your decision-making process**. Therefore, when analyzing any case, you must:

1. **Systematic Deconstruction**: Begin by breaking down the problem from a macro perspective, identifying core clinical contradictions and key information.
2. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Provide independent and thorough analysis of all possibilities (including every option), without skipping any.
3. **Clear Reasoning**: Explicitly articulate the "because-therefore" logic behind each judgment, clearly stating which specific clinical indicators, guideline consensus, or pathophysiological principles your decisions are based on.
4. **Principle Extraction**: After analysis, skillfully distill complex individual case decision processes into reusable, instructive core principles.

Your language should combine authority with clarity, enabling listeners to fully replicate your thought process."""

    @staticmethod
    def get_analysis_prompt(question_data: Dict) -> str:
        question = question_data['question']
        options = question_data['options']
  
        options_text = ""
        for opt in options:
            options_text += f"({opt['letter']}) {opt['content']}\n"
        return f"""Analyze this cardiovascular medicine multiple-choice question systematically and select the SINGLE CORRECT ANSWER. Provide a comprehensive analysis that demonstrates expert clinical reasoning.

    **Part 1: Clinical Context Analysis**

    Begin by establishing the clinical foundation for this question:

    * **Clinical Scenario Identification**: What is the primary clinical situation being presented? (e.g., diagnostic workup, treatment decision, risk stratification, pathophysiology question, etc.)

    * **Key Clinical Elements**: What are the most important clinical details, patient characteristics, findings, or parameters mentioned in the question stem? Why are these details clinically significant?

    Now analyze each answer choice methodically:

    **Option (A): **
    * **Clinical Evaluation**: How does this option relate to the clinical scenario? What would be the clinical implications if this were the correct choice?
    * **Evidence-Based Assessment**: Based on current guidelines, evidence, and pathophysiology, is this option clinically appropriate? Why or why not?

    **Option (B): **
    * **Clinical Evaluation**: [Same analysis format]
    * **Evidence-Based Assessment**: [Same analysis format]

    [Continue this systematic analysis for each option through the last one]

    **Part 3: Final Answer and Clinical Synthesis**

    * **Clinical Summary**: Briefly synthesize the key clinical scenario from the question stem and the critical findings from my analysis of each option.

    * **Selected Answer**: Based on my systematic analysis, the correct answer is: **(Letter) [Brief restatement of the correct option]**

    * **Answer Justification**: Concisely explain why this is the best answer, focusing on the most compelling clinical evidence and reasoning.

    * **Option Comparison Summary**: Provide a brief comparative overview of why the chosen option is superior to the other alternatives, highlighting the key clinical distinctions.

    * **Clinical Teaching Point**: Detailedly summarize the essential clinical medicine principle demonstrated by this question as a practical clinical pearl.

In order to chain the above components together, we designed two processors. `CardioAnalysisProcessor` is responsible for handling a single question: it combines the Prompt, calls the API, and returns a structured result. Meanwhile, `BatchProcessor` uses a thread pool (`ThreadPoolExecutor`) to achieve high-concurrency processing, allowing all filtered questions to be handed over to `CardioAnalysisProcessor` in batches and in parallel, while automatically saving the results of each batch. This design is a necessary guarantee for achieving production-level data processing efficiency.

        return filepath

By running the above batch processing workflow, we send all cardiovascular-related test questions to the LLM for in-depth analysis, and collect the returned detailed analysis texts (including clinical scenario analysis, option discrimination, core principle summaries, etc.), preparing the data for the next step of concept extraction.

Now, we have a large collection of in-depth analytical texts about cardiovascular issues generated by LLMs. The next task is to extract all the core medical concepts from these unstructured texts. Once again, we rely on the LLM to accomplish this task, and the key to success still lies in a well-designed Prompt. The `PromptTemplate` has been redesigned to guide the LLM to play the role of a cardiovascular expert, following a series of strict extraction principles (such as extracting core terms, avoiding descriptive combinations, outputting in standard JSON format, etc.), ensuring that the final concept list is clean and standardized.


```python
class PromptTemplate:

    @staticmethod
    def get_system_prompt() -> str:

        return """You are an experienced cardiovascular specialist, skilled in identifying and extracting medical concept terms from clinical texts.

Extraction principles:
- Only extract cardiovascular-related medical concepts, terms, and nouns
- Only concept terms, not complete definitions or explanations
- Prefer single core terms (e.g., "myocardial infarction", "hypertension", "echocardiography")
- Use phrases only when they represent standard medical terminology that cannot be meaningfully separated (e.g., "atrial fibrillation", "coronary artery disease")
- Avoid descriptive combinations (e.g., "severe hypertension" → "hypertension")
- Avoid overly vague terms (e.g., "heart problem")
- Include but not limited to disease names, examination methods, drug treatments, anatomical structures, physiological indicators, clinical manifestations, assessment tools, and all other related concepts
- Remove duplicate concepts
- Sort by importance

    @staticmethod
    def get_extraction_prompt(text_content: str) -> str:

        return f"""**Task: Extract concept terms from cardiovascular clinical text**

    "concept2",
    "concept3",
    "..."
]
}}"""
```

After the above steps, we successfully extracted a preliminary list of seed concepts in the cardiovascular field from the massive amount of analyzed text. This list laid a solid foundation for the subsequent iterative expansion of the concept map.

**Example Results:**

```python
seed_concepts = [
    'blood pressure', 'step-up', 'glucagon', 'therapeutic anticoagulation'...
]
```

### **Iterative Concept Graph Augmentation Method**

#### **Core Objective**

To achieve complete coverage of the target domain for the concept graph through iterative augmentation. We adopt a gradual expansion strategy based on LLM, starting from a seed concept set, expanding round by round, and ultimately constructing a comprehensive domain concept graph.

#### **Iterative Process**

The basic iterative process is as follows:

- **Input**: The concept graph generated in the previous iteration.
- **Processing**: For each concept node in the graph, provide itself and its known adjacent concepts as context information to the LLM, and request the LLM to generate more other concepts directly related to this central concept.
- **Output**: After post-processing (e.g., deduplication), the new concepts returned by the LLM are added to the concept graph, serving as the input for the next iteration.

#### **Convergence Mechanism and Control Parameters**

As the iteration progresses, newly generated concepts will increasingly overlap with existing concepts in the graph, causing the iterative process to converge naturally. We have designed three core parameters to precisely control this process:

1.  **Similar Node Merging Threshold (`similarity_threshold`)**

    * **Mechanism**: Use an embedding model to calculate the vector representation of concepts and judge the semantic similarity between two concepts using cosine similarity.
    * **Effect**: When the similarity between two concepts exceeds the set threshold, they will be merged into a single node in the graph.
    * **Impact**: This parameter directly controls the "granularity" and expansion speed of the concept graph and is key to balancing the completeness of the graph with computational cost.
2.  **New Concept Growth Rate (`new_concept_rate_threshold`)**

    * **Mechanism**: Calculate the proportion of new concepts generated in the current round that do not exist in the original graph (i.e., are "brand new").
    * **Effect**: When this proportion falls below the set threshold, it can be considered that the graph is approaching saturation in terms of conceptual breadth, and the iteration is stopped.
3.  **New Edge Growth Rate (`new_edge_rate_threshold`)**

    * **Mechanism**: Calculate the growth rate of the number of new connections (edges) established in the current round between existing old concepts in the graph.
    * **Effect**: When the relationship network between concepts becomes more complete and the growth of new connections slows down significantly, the iteration is stoppe
    * **Significance**: This metric primarily reflects the integrity of the internal structure of the concept graph.

#### **Parameter Selection Strategy and Convergence Analysis**

In the absence of an external evaluation dataset, how to select hyperparameters and determine convergence is a critical practical issue.

1.  **Similar Node Merging Threshold (`similarity_threshold`)**: **The core metric for controlling the iteration rate.**
    Theoretically, it is possible to build the most comprehensive concept graph without merging any similar nodes, but this would incur enormous computational costs. Therefore, setting a reasonable threshold is crucial. Each core node ultimately existing in the graph can be understood as a **representative concept** within the semantic space defined by this threshold. This parameter is the core regulator for balancing the completeness of the graph with computational efficiency. For academic research scenarios requiring extreme coverage, a higher threshold (e.g., 0.95) can be set; for practical applications focusing on cost-effectiveness, a lower threshold (e.g., 0.80) can be set.
2.  **New Concept Growth Rate**: **The metric that converges first but may stagnate.**
    As the iteration progresses, the new concept growth rate will be the first to show a convergence trend. However, in practice, it has been found that after converging to a certain extent, this metric may stagnate at a low level without approaching zero completely. The root cause is that the LLM may gradually "drift" outside the strict domain boundaries when performing conceptual association. Therefore, one cannot rely solely on this metric to determine if the iteration is complete.
3.  **New Edge Growth Rate**: **The metric that ultimately converges stably.**
    When most of the core concepts of the target domain (e.g., the cardiovascular field) have been captured and their main relationships established, most subsequently added nodes are located on the "periphery" of the domain. It is difficult for these peripheral nodes to establish new, meaningful connections with the old nodes in the core area of the graph. This leads to a stable decline and eventual convergence of the growth rate of new edges between old concepts. Compared to the new concept growth rate, this metric is less affected by the LLM's "cross-domain expansion" characteristic and is a reliable indicator for judging the **structural integrity** of the concept graph.

**Practical Strategy Recommendation**: Under limited costs, adopt a balanced `similarity_threshold` (e.g., 0.80) and observe the convergence curve in conjunction with the Elbow Method. When the new concept growth rate and the new edge growth rate show no significant change for 1-2 consecutive rounds and enter a plateau phase, the iteration can be stopped.
---

### **Core Code Implementation**

We transform the theory above into a self-growing concept graph system.

#### **1. Core Data Structure: The `ConceptGraph` Class**

The core of the system is the `ConceptGraph` class, which is an "intelligent graph" that integrates semantic understanding and dynamic update capabilities.

* **Initialization (`__init__`)**: Starts with a batch of pre-processed seed concepts, calculates their vector embeddings, and builds the initial state of the graph.
* **Intelligent Deduplication (`_is_similar_to_existing`)**: This is key to controlling the quality and scale of the graph. It utilizes the cosine similarity of semantic vectors to determine if a new concept is semantically "close" to an existing concept in the graph. Concepts are merged only when the similarity exceeds the set `similarity_threshold`.
* **Dynamic Update (`update_graph`)**: This is the core engine of the graph's "growth". This method receives new concepts augmented by the LLM, and through the intelligent deduplication mechanism, adds truly "brand new" concepts as new nodes to the graph and establishes connections with the source concept.
* **State Monitoring (`calculate_metrics`, `get_graph_stats`)**: These methods are responsible for calculating the convergence metrics we have defined (such as new concept growth rate, new edge growth rate) and the graph's statistics (number of nodes, number of edges), thereby enabling quantitative monitoring of the effect of each iteration.

#### **2. Complete Augmentation Process Code**

The complete iterative process consists of an executable "single-round concept augmentation" pipeline, which integrates multiple components:

* **Utility Tools (`ResponseValidator`, `load_embedding_model`)**: Used to handle common problems in engineering practice, such as fixing malformed JSON returned by the LLM, and loading and managing deep learning models.
* **LLM Interaction Module (`APIClient`, `PromptTemplate`)**: A specially designed `PromptTemplate` is used to guide the LLM to perform "association" and "augmentation" based on existing concepts in the graph.
* **Concurrency Processor (`ConceptExpander`, `BatchConceptExpander`)**: Responsible for treating each concept node in the graph as an independent task, requesting augmentation from the LLM in parallel to ensure processing efficiency.
* **Iteration Master Control (`run_concept_expansion_iteration`)**: This is a top-level function responsible for orchestrating all the components above to completely execute one round of the "get current graph -> concurrent augmentation -> update graph -> calculate metrics" cycle.

**Instructions**:

1. Instead of generate general medical concept, focus on generating new cardiovascular-domain concepts that are directly relevant in clinical scenarios to "{center_concept}" with strong clinical medical relation
2. Do not repeat any existing connected concepts listed above
3. Prefer single core terms (e.g., "myocardial infarction", "hypertension", "echocardiography")
4. Use phrases only when they represent standard medical terminology that cannot be meaningfully separated (e.g., "atrial fibrillation", "coronary artery disease")
5. Avoid descriptive combinations (e.g., "severe hypertension" → "hypertension")
6. Avoid overly vague terms (e.g., "heart problem")
7. Generate concepts that are directly related to the center concept
8. Do not repeat any existing connected concepts listed above; Avoid duplicate concepts"""

### **Expansion Startup: Preparation and Execution**

Before initiating large-scale iterations, we perform an internal semantic deduplication on the initial `seed_concepts` list. The `deduplicate_seed_concepts` function compares the semantic similarity of each pair of seed concepts and discards highly similar duplicates to ensure the purity of the initial graph.

After cleaning, we use this high-quality seed set to officially create a `ConceptGraph` instance, preparing for the first round of expansion.

Load the embedding model to filter similar seed concepts:

---


```python
import json
import pickle
import time
import torch
import numpy as np
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from datetime import datetime

device = 'cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'
print(f"Initialize model, use device: {device}")
model = SentenceTransformer(EMBEDDING_MODEL, trust_remote_code=True, device=device)
print("Model initialization completed")
```

Initialize concept_graph according to seed concepts:

```python

import random
import numpy as np

def deduplicate_seed_concepts(seed_concepts, model, similarity_threshold=0.95):
    """Deduplicates seed concepts. For pairs with similarity exceeding the threshold, one is randomly kept."""
    
    embeddings = model.encode(seed_concepts)
    similarities = model.similarity(embeddings, embeddings)
    similarities = similarities.cpu().numpy()
    
    to_remove = set()
    n = len(seed_concepts)
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            if similarities[i][j] > similarity_threshold:
                # Similarity exceeds threshold, randomly choose one to remove
                remove_idx = random.choice([i, j])
                to_remove.add(remove_idx)
                print(f"Similar concept pair: '{seed_concepts[i]}' vs '{seed_concepts[j]}' (Similarity: {similarities[i][j]:.4f})")
                print(f"  -> Removing: '{seed_concepts[remove_idx]}'")
    
    filtered_concepts = [concept for i, concept in enumerate(seed_concepts) if i not in to_remove]
    
    print(f"\nDeduplication result: {len(seed_concepts)} -> {len(filtered_concepts)} concepts")
    print(f"Removed {len(to_remove)} similar concepts")
    
    return filtered_concepts

# Example usage
filtered_seed_concepts = deduplicate_seed_concepts(seed_concepts, model, similarity_threshold=0.8)
concept_graph = ConceptGraph(filtered_seed_concepts, model, similarity_threshold=0.8)
```

By repeatedly executing the `run_concept_expansion_iteration` function, we can complete multiple rounds of expansion. After each round of expansion, we recommend persisting the updated graph structure (`graph_dict`) and the concept mapping table (`concept_mapping`) as `.pkl` files, in order to prevent the results of long-running processes from being lost due to unexpected interruptions. This process will continue until the preset convergence metric reaches the threshold.

### **Experimental Data and Evaluation**

We conducted comprehensive experimental validation in two medical domains, cardiovascular (cardio) and respiratory, using two models, GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o, performing multi-round iterative augmentation under different similarity thresholds (0.8, 0.85, 0.9). The validation method involved extracting keywords from Wikipedia medical articles in the corresponding domains and calculating the coverage rate of the concept graph.

#### **Experimental Setup**

- **Datasets**: Cardiovascular domain (cardio), Respiratory system domain (respiratory)
- **Models**: GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4o
- **Similarity Thresholds**: 0.8, 0.85, 0.9
- **Evaluation Metric**: Wikipedia keyword coverage rate (at the three thresholds of 0.8, 0.85, 0.9)
- **Cost Benchmark**: Approximately $20 for GPT-4o-mini to complete 8 iterations

#### **Metric Descriptions**

- **Node Count**: Total number of all concepts seen (including concepts judged as similar + concepts retained in the graph)
- **Edge Count**: Total number of edges in the concept graph
- **New Concept Rate**: Number of new nodes added to the concept graph / Total number of concepts generated in the current round
- **New Edge Rate**: Number of new edges added between old nodes / Number of edges before adding new edges between old nodes
- **Cost Estimate**: Calculated based on the total number of concepts generated in the current and previous rounds, estimated according to the rate of gpt-4o-mini for 8 iterations

#### **Key Findings and Analysis**

##### **1. Convergence Validation: Convergence Tendency Observed Under All Settings**

All experimental setups demonstrated a clear convergence trend:

- **New Concept Growth Rate**: Steadily decreased from an initial 10-13% to 3-5%, validating the saturation of the graph in terms of concept coverage.
- **New Edge Growth Rate**: Gradually converged from a peak in the 2nd round (46-71%) to 15-20%, confirming the refinement of the relationship network between concepts.
- **Coverage Rate Plateau**: After 4-5 rounds, the growth in coverage rate slowed down significantly, entering a state of convergence.

##### **2. Model Difference Analysis: Quality vs. Cost Trade-off**

**GPT-4o Advantages**:

- **Higher Coverage Rate**: Under the same number of rounds, GPT-4o typically achieves a 2-4 percentage point higher coverage than GPT-4o-mini.
- **Faster Convergence**: Requires fewer rounds to reach the same coverage rate.
- **Better Concept Quality**: Reflected in a higher matching rate with Wikipedia keywords.

**Cost Analysis**:

- **GPT-4o Cost**: The absolute cost is approximately 8-15 times that of GPT-4o-mini.
- **Performance Improvement**: The increase in coverage rate is typically in the range of **2-4%**.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: GPT-4o-mini offers a better cost-effectiveness ratio in most practical application scenarios.

##### **3. Impact of Similarity Threshold: Balancing Precision and Efficiency**

- **Threshold 0.8**: Rapid expansion, but may include more similar concepts.
- **Threshold 0.85**: A balanced choice, suitable for most application scenarios.
- **Threshold 0.9**: High precision but slower expansion speed, suitable for scenarios requiring extremely high concept purity.

##### **4. Cross-Domain Consistency: The Universality of the Method**

The experimental results in both the cardiovascular and respiratory domains were highly consistent, validating the robustness of the method:

- Similar convergence patterns
- Consistent coverage rate trends
- Similar cost-effectiveness ratios

#### **Practical Recommendations**

**Cost-Priority Scenarios (Recommended)**:

- Use GPT-4o-mini + Threshold 0.8
- Achieve 95%+ coverage within 4-5 rounds of iteration.
- Keep costs within the $3-10 range.

**Quality-Priority Scenarios**:

- Use GPT-4o + Threshold 0.85
- Can achieve a high coverage rate of 97%+
- Requires bearing a significant increase in cost.

**Balanced Scenarios**:

- Use GPT-4o-mini + Threshold 0.85
- Achieve a coverage rate of 94-97%
- Moderate cost, acceptable quality.

## **Knowledge Distillation and QA Memory Generation Based on the Concept Graph**

After multiple rounds of iteration, we have constructed a large and structurally rich concept relationship network. However, this network is currently just a "skeleton." To make it a knowledge base that can be directly utilized by AI, we need to fill it with specific content—namely, high-quality Question-Answering (QA) pairs. This process, we call **"Knowledge Distillation"**.

Our strategy is divided into two steps:

1. Generate independent QA pairs for each **single concept node** in the graph to establish foundational knowledge.
2. Generate relational QA pairs for each **connected concept pair** (edge) with clinical significance in the graph to build deep knowledge.

To achieve this goal, we built the `ConceptDistiller` and its accompanying prompt. This prompt is designed to guide a powerful "teacher" model (like GPT-4o) to transform an isolated medical concept into a teaching-grade question and answer, rich with clinical scenarios and testing comprehensive reasoning abilities. These QA pairs will become the memory content for the "student" model (the small model we ultimately aim to enhance).

```

Before running large-scale batch processing, it is a good practice to verify whether the Prompt and code logic work as expected. The following code is exactly such a unit test: it uses “atrial fibrillation (atrial\_fibrillation)” as an example and calls the `test_single_concept_distillation` function to test the QA generation effect for a single concept.

```python
test_single_concept_distillation('atrial_fibrillation')
```

In actual practice, we may not need to generate QA for all concepts in the graph. Depending on the project goals, we can choose an appropriate subset. As mentioned at the beginning of this section, our strategy is to select a medium-scale subgraph (nodes after 3 iterations) but with more mature connections (edges after 5 iterations) as the scope for knowledge distillation.

The following code is precisely for achieving this goal. It first loads two graph files from different iteration stages, and then, through the `extract_subgraph` and `extract_unique_edges` functions, precisely constructs the target graph `filtered_graph` that we will use for QA generation.

```python
# Filter to get the current target concept graph

import pickle
with open('cookbooktest/Cardio/concept_graph_4omini_5_iter.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    concept_dict = pickle.load(f)

import pickle
with open('cookbooktest/Cardio/concept_graph_4omini_3_iter.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    sub_concept_dict = pickle.load(f)

def extract_subgraph(full_graph_dict, sub_concept_set):
    """Extracts a subgraph, keeping only specified concepts and the edges between them"""
    
    # If sub_concept_set is a dict, take its keys; if it's a list/set, use it directly
    if isinstance(sub_concept_set, dict):
        valid_concepts = set(sub_concept_set.keys())
    else:
        valid_concepts = set(sub_concept_set)
    
    subgraph = {}
    
    for concept, neighbors in full_graph_dict.items():
        # Only process concepts that are in the subset
        if concept in valid_concepts:
            # Only keep neighbors that are also in the subset
            filtered_neighbors = [n for n in neighbors if n in valid_concepts]
            if filtered_neighbors:  # Only keep nodes that have neighbors
                subgraph[concept] = filtered_neighbors
    
    print(f"Original graph: {len(full_graph_dict)} nodes")
    print(f"Subgraph: {len(subgraph)} nodes")
    
    # Count edges
    total_edges = sum(len(neighbors) for neighbors in subgraph.values())
    print(f"Subgraph edge count: {total_edges}")
    
    return subgraph

filtered_graph = extract_subgraph(concept_dict, sub_concept_dict)

# Remove duplicate edges
def extract_unique_edges(graph_dict):
    """Extracts unique edge pairs from the graph, keeping only one of each bidirectional edge"""
    
    processed_pairs = set()
    unique_edges = []
    
    for concept_a, neighbors in graph_dict.items():
        for concept_b in neighbors:
            # Sort to ensure (A,B) and (B,A) are treated as the same pair
            edge = tuple(sorted([concept_a, concept_b]))
    
            if edge not in processed_pairs:
                processed_pairs.add(edge)
                unique_edges.append(edge)
    
    print(f"Total edges: {sum(len(neighbors) for neighbors in graph_dict.values())}")
    print(f"Edges after deduplication: {len(unique_edges)}")
    
    return unique_edges

# Usage
unique_edges = extract_unique_edges(filtered_graph)

# View the first few edges
print("First 5 edges:")
for i, (a, b) in enumerate(unique_edges[:5]):
    print(f"{i+1}. {a} <-> {b}")
```

```python
# Batch QA extraction for single concepts
results = distill_concept_graph(
    concept_graph_dict=example_concept_dict,
    max_workers=100,      # Concurrency count
    batch_size=1000,      # Batch size
    output_dir="cookbooktest/Cardio",  # Save location
    api_url=api_url, 
    api_key=api_key, 
    model_name=QA_SYNTHESIZER
)
```

In practice, we selected a subgraph of medium scale (nodes after 3 iterations) but with more mature connections (edges after 5 iterations) as the scope for knowledge distillation, in order to balance the breadth and depth of knowledge. For concept-pair knowledge distillation, we designed a more complex two-stage “Evaluation–Generation” Prompt. The LLM first acts as a “filter,” strictly evaluating the clinical relevance and educational value of the concept pairs. Only the “golden combinations” that pass this evaluation proceed to the second stage, where a logically more complex QA pair is generated that simultaneously covers both concepts.

```python
# For the problem generation and extraction of concept pairs, we will not discuss them in detail. We provide prompt as inspiration:
    @staticmethod
    def get_pair_system_prompt() -> str:

        return """You are a world-renowned cardiovascular specialist with 20+ years of clinical experience. Your task is to rigorously evaluate concept pairs and generate high-quality educational content. You must act as a **strict filter**, approving only pairs with a **direct, critical, and undeniable link** in clinical practice and training."""

    @staticmethod
    def get_pair_prompt(concept_pairs: List[tuple]) -> str:

        pairs_text = ""
        for i, (concept_a, concept_b) in enumerate(concept_pairs, 1):
            pairs_text += f"{i}. {concept_a} <-> {concept_b}\n"
  
        return f"""**CONCEPT PAIRS TO EVALUATE:**
{pairs_text}

For each pair, you must strictly evaluate the following two criteria. **BOTH must be strongly true** to proceed.

1.  **Direct Clinical Relevance**: Is there a **direct causal, pathophysiological, diagnostic, or therapeutic link** between the two concepts? The connection should not just a weak, coincidental, or indirect association. One concept must frequently and directly influence the consideration of the other in **critical clinical decision-making**.

2.  **Essential Educational Value**: Does understanding this specific link teach a **crucial, non-obvious clinical reasoning skill**? The relationship should highlight a common point of confusion to be clarified, a key differential diagnosis, or a pivotal management decision. It must be more than a simple factual association.

**EXAMPLE OF A PAIR TO REJECT:**
- `"Hypertension" <-> "Stethoscope"`: While a stethoscope is used in the diagnosis of hypertension, this is a basic procedural fact.

For each pair that meet the stringent criteria:
1. Generate 1 clinical question covering BOTH concepts.
2. Every condition mentioned must be CRITICAL to the clinical decision - avoid redundant details
3. Use general descriptors (elderly patient, young adult) rather than specific ages
4. Focus on decision-making situations where simultaneously considering the concept pairs is central
5. **AVOID simple factual questions** - require clinical integration and reasoning

**OUTPUT FORMAT (strict JSON):**
{{
  "evaluated_pairs": [
    {{
      "concept_pair": ["concept_a", "concept_b"],

## **QA Data Structure Example**

All QA data generated through the knowledge distillation process will be organized into a unified, standardized JSON object format, to facilitate subsequent program reading and processing. This structure contains the following key fields:

* `concept`: Source of knowledge, which can be a single concept (string) or a concept pair (list).
* `question`: The core clinical question.
* `reasoning_guidance`: The clinical reasoning pathway for solving the problem.
* `knowledge_facts`: The core knowledge points required to answer the question.
* `final_answer`: A comprehensive and authoritative answer to the question.

We name the entire collection of formatted QA data as `qa_collection`.

1. **single concept QA example**

```python
{'concept': 'ankylosing spondylitis',
 'question': 'A young adult patient with a 5-year history of ankylosing spondylitis presents with unexplained fatigue and palpitations. Laboratory tests reveal anemia and elevated acute phase reactants. In the context of ankylosing spondylitis, what cardiovascular complication should be explored, and what is the likely mechanism of the heart condition related to this systemic inflammatory disease?',
 'reasoning_guidance': 'Identify the common systemic manifestations of ankylosing spondylitis including inflammation and anemia. Consider the cardiovascular implications of chronic inflammation and anemia on cardiac function. Explore the mechanism by which systemic diseases like ankylosing spondylitis can result in heart conditions such as myocardial fibrosis or dysfunction.',
 'knowledge_facts': ['ankylosing spondylitis can cause systemic inflammation, contributing to cardiovascular complications like myocardial fibrosis.',
  'ankylosing spondylitis-associated inflammation can lead to chronic anemia, affecting cardiovascular health.',
  'ankylosing spondylitis may lead to cardiac conduction system involvement, resulting in palpitations.'],
 'final_answer': "Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, myocardial fibrosis due to systemic inflammation related to ankylosing spondylitis should be explored. The fatigue and palpitations may be due, in part, to anemia exacerbating cardiac stress, and inflammation leading to fibrosis, altering cardiac conduction and function."}

```

2. **Concept Pair QA Example**

```python
{'concept': ['apical hypertrophy of the lv', 'myocardial ischaemia'],
 'question': 'A middle-aged adult with a history of hypertension presents with exertional chest pain. Echocardiography reveals apical hypertrophy of the left ventricle. How would you differentiate between hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and myocardial ischaemia as the cause of the symptoms?',
 'reasoning_guidance': 'Consider the role of diagnostic imaging and stress testing in distinguishing between structural heart changes and ischemic heart conditions. Evaluate the characteristic findings of apical hypertrophy and myocardial ischemia.',
 'knowledge_facts': ['Apical hypertrophy can mimic signs of myocardial ischaemia.',
  'Myocardial ischaemia is often indicated by ST-segment changes during stress.',
  'Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may present with specific echocardiographic patterns of ventricular thickening.'],
 'final_answer': 'To differentiate hypertrophic cardiomyopathy from myocardial ischaemia, perform a stress test to assess for changes indicative of ischemia and use advanced imaging modalities like cardiac MRI, which can provide detailed myocardial characterization.'}

```

---

## **Final Step: Build and Export MemCube**

At this point, all data preparation work has been completed. We now need to assemble these independent “knowledge units” (`qa_collection`) into a powerful, interconnected knowledge network—**MemCube**.

The construction process is as follows:

1. **Concepts as the skeleton**: Each “concept” in the concept graph becomes an independent **node** in MemCube.
2. **QAs as the flesh**: Each “QA pair” also becomes an independent **node**, connected to one or two concept nodes from which it originates.
3. **Questions as the index**: We **vectorize the question text** in each QA node, using it as the semantic “address” within the memory network for fast retrieval.

The following Python script accomplishes this transformation in one step. It loads `qa_collection`, extracts and creates all concept nodes and QA nodes, then establishes relational edges between nodes based on predefined logic. Finally, it assembles all nodes and edges into a complete JSON object conforming to the MemOS format, and exports it as a file.

### **Loading MemCube**

Now, it’s time to inject this “digital blueprint” into a high-performance persistent storage, turning it into a MemCube that can be accessed in real time by MemOS.

We provide a performance-optimized bulk import tool script, which bypasses the bottleneck of adding items one by one and instead loads the entire MemCube directly and efficiently, while ensuring its data structure is fully compatible with MemOS. The core tasks of this script include: creating database constraints, bulk importing nodes and edges, creating vector indexes (the core for achieving millisecond-level semantic search), and compatibility validation.

#### **Load MemCube in MemOS**

Once the data is successfully imported, our cardiovascular MemCube is officially “online.” In the application, we only need to initialize MemOS’s `TreeTextMemory` through a configuration file pointing to the database. After that, we can interact with the vast knowledge base via the `tree_memory` object, granting the AI specialized domain memory.

```python
from memos.configs.memory import TreeTextMemoryConfig
from memos.memories.textual.tree import TreeTextMemory

## **Performance Evaluation Report: MemCube Memory Enhancement Framework Verification**

### **Evaluation Method**

To quantify the performance improvements brought by Cardiovascular MemCube, we built an automated evaluation pipeline. The core of this process is: using a powerful third-party model (such as Gemini-2.5-Pro) as a neutral “examiner” to verify the improvement in a MemCube-equipped model’s ability to solve professional problems.

#### Example Evaluation Questions

---


```python
# questions (partial in 200 questions)
 'A 65-year-old male patient presents to the emergency department with severe lower abdominal pain, inability to urinate, and is complaining of lightheadedness and palpitations. His past medical history includes hypertension controlled with lisinopril, benign prostatic hyperplasia for which he has been taking tamsulosin, and moderate alcohol use. On examination, his heart rate is elevated at 105 beats per minute, blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg, and he appears uncomfortable. Palpation reveals a distended bladder. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia without ischemic changes. You suspect bladder distension might be causing autonomic reflex changes affecting cardiac function. Considering this scenario, explain the physiological mechanism by which bladder distension might result in cardiac symptoms, and outline your approach to managing this patient to resolve both the urinary and cardiovascular concerns.',
 'In an elderly patient with poorly controlled diabetes, how do advanced glycation end products (AGEs) contribute to the pathophysiology of endothelial injury, and what implications does this have for the management of cardiovascular risks?',
 'A middle-aged patient with venous insufficiency is monitored using transcutaneous oxygen measurements to assess tissue perfusion. How does venous insufficiency affect transcutaneous oxygen levels, and how should these results influence treatment decisions for skin ulcers?',
 'A young adult with confirmed tubular acidosis is presenting with significant metabolic acidosis. How would sodium bicarbonate therapy be utilized in this case, and what are the considerations for its dosages and effects?'
```

```python
 
#### Core Retrieval Process Implementation

# The following script demonstrates the retrieval steps based on MemCube: using the `tree_memory.search()` method.

# It precisely identifies the knowledge fragments from our massive MemCube that are semantically most similar to the current exam question.

# You may also configure a chat model afterward, thereby directly enabling conversational functionality.

# question_list: A list of similar questions provided by the user for retrieval.

# For example: ['What are the signs of a myocardial infarction?', 'What are the potential dangers of high blood pressure?']

question_list = ['What are the signs of a myocardial infarction?', 'What are the potential dangers of high blood pressure?']
search_results_dict = {}

for i, question in enumerate(question_list):
    print(i)
    results = tree_memory.search(question, top_k=15)
    # Exclude short pure concept nodes
    filtered_results = [node.memory for node in results if len(node.memory) > 100]
    search_results_dict[i] = {

#### **Key Insights Analysis**

1. **For large models, precise domain knowledge remains crucial**: Results show that equipping the 32B-parameter model with MemCube gives it an overwhelming advantage (92 wins, 0 losses). This confirms that even for large models with strong baseline capabilities, a structured external domain knowledge base can still deliver a decisive performance boost, especially in professional fields where precision of knowledge is critical.
2. **Memory system enables “small to beat big”**: In the cross-level comparison between the 7B model and the 32B base model, the 7B model equipped with MemCube achieved a remarkable 57 wins and 3 losses. This clearly demonstrates that a well-designed memory system can effectively compensate for the knowledge limitations of smaller models, enabling them to outperform general-purpose models many times larger in specific domains.
3. **Memory system has universal effectiveness**: Whether it is the 7B or the 32B model, once equipped with MemCube, their professionalism and accuracy of responses improve significantly. This indicates that the “Concept Graph – Knowledge Distillation – Memory Augmentation” framework proposed in this chapter is a universally applicable and efficient approach to enhancing AI capabilities.

### **In-depth Analysis of Representative Cases**

To better understand the working mechanism of MemCube, we conducted an in-depth analysis of selected evaluation cases.

#### **Case Analysis 1 (7B Model, ID: 9): Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) Case**

**Clinical Question**: Involves a 6-year-old child with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), who was referred to the cardiovascular department for systemic evaluation due to microvascular changes in the fundus. The question requires assessing which cardiovascular examinations should be conducted, and how the fundus findings affect the cardiovascular evaluation strategy.

**Clinical Question**:

```
A 6-year-old child is referred to your cardiovascular clinic for evaluation after being diagnosed with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). The ophthalmologist has noted significant retinal vessel changes and has expressed concerns regarding the child's cardiovascular health given the potential systemic implications of microvascular changes observed in ROP. As you assess the child, you consider possible cardiovascular complications that may arise. What cardiovascular assessments would be pertinent in this case, and how might the existing retinal findings influence your cardiovascular evaluation strategy, particularly concerning microvascular health and its potential systemic effects?

{'model': 'qwen2.5-7b-instruct', 'version': 'v2', 'question_id': 9, 'prompt': "As an experienced medical expert, provide comprehensive analysis using evidence-based medicine principles.\n\n**CLINICAL CASE:**\nA 6-year-old child is referred to your cardiovascular clinic for evaluation after being diagnosed with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). The ophthalmologist has noted significant retinal vessel changes and has expressed concerns regarding the child's cardiovascular health given the potential systemic implications of microvascular changes observed in ROP. As you assess the child, you consider possible cardiovascular complications that may arise. What cardiovascular assessments would be pertinent in this case, and how might the existing retinal findings influence your cardiovascular evaluation strategy, particularly concerning microvascular health and its potential systemic effects?\n\n**KEY EVIDENCE:**\n• Question: A young child presents with suspected retinopathy of prematurity, potentially linked to a congenital heart defect that has led to inconsistent oxygen delivery. As a cardiovascular specialist, how would you approach the management of this child's systemic condition to optimize retinal health?\n\nReasoning Guidance: Evaluate the impact of the congenital heart defect on systemic oxygenation. Consider the role of oxygen supplementation and monitoring. Integrate cardiovascular management strategies with ophthalmologic treatment to optimize retinal health.\n\nKnowledge Facts: Pediatric retinal disorders often involve insufficient retinal vascular development.; Pediatric retinal disorders can be exacerbated by systemic oxygen imbalances, common in congenital heart defects.; Effective management of pediatric retinal disorder requires collaboration with ophthalmology and cardiology.\n\nAnswer: The management involves stabilizing systemic oxygen levels through correction of the heart defect, if feasible, and careful use of supplemental oxygen. Coordination with an ophthalmologist to monitor retinal changes and implement laser therapy or surgical interventions may be required.\n• Question: During a cardiovascular examination, a pediatric patient with coexisting retinal and cardiovascular disorders seems to have poor growth despite appropriate medical interventions. What could be the systemic implications of these concurrent conditions, and how should clinical decision-making address these concerns?\n\nReasoning Guidance: Integrate understanding of pediatric retinal disorder with the potential cardiovascular inefficiencies causing poor systemic circulation and growth delays. Consider multidisciplinary approaches for these intertwined issues, promoting comprehensive care strategies.\n\nKnowledge Facts: Pediatric retinal disorders and cardiac anomalies can have overlapping pathogenic mechanisms affecting systemic development.; A comprehensive clinical approach involves assessing the interplay between circulatory efficiency and ocular vascular health.; Addressing underlying cardiovascular inefficiencies may relieve secondary complications impacting systemic development.\n\nAnswer: The clinical approach should prioritize optimization of cardiovascular function to improve circulation efficiencies, potentially benefiting retinal health and promoting growth. Collaboration across specialties, including cardiology, ophthalmology, and pediatrics, is crucial for comprehensive systemic management.\n• Question: A young adult with a history of pediatric retinal disorder secondary to Kawasaki disease is undergoing cardiovascular follow-up for potential coronary artery complications. How can ongoing retinal issues influence cardiovascular management?\n\nReasoning Guidance: Assess how retinal issues, such as impaired visual acuity or peripheral vision loss, might affect compliance or understanding of cardiovascular treatment plans. Consider unique strategies in communication or monitoring to enhance treatment adherence.\n\nKnowledge Facts: Pediatric retinal disorders can result from inflammatory conditions like Kawasaki disease impacting vasculature.; In patients with persistent retinal disorder consequences, visual limitations could obstruct understanding of complex medical instructions.; Cardiovascular management must adapt to individual patient's sensory and learning capabilities, ensuring thorough education about treatment and prevention strategies.\n\nAnswer: Management may require tailored communication strategies, ensuring the patient fully understands and is capable of following the prescribed cardiovascular treatment. Regular check-ups should integrate assessments of retinal status to anticipate any complications affecting routine cardiovascular care.\n• Question: A premature infant is undergoing ophthalmic screening for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). What complications, if untreated, might arise related to the retina?\n\nReasoning Guidance: Understand how untreated ROP can lead to tractional retinal detachment in premature infants.\n\nKnowledge Facts: Retinopathy of prematurity involves abnormal retinal vessel development.; Advanced ROP can result in retinal traction and detachment.; Screening and early treatment are critical in preventing detachment.\n\nAnswer: Regular screening and timely intervention, such as laser photocoagulation, are essential to prevent retinal detachment.\n\nPlease provide evidence-based medical analysis and management recommendations.", 'response': "### Comprehensive Analysis and Management Recommendations for a Child with Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) and Potential Cardiovascular Complications\n\n#### Clinical Case Overview\nA 6-year-old child has been referred to a cardiovascular clinic for evaluation due to a diagnosis of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). The ophthalmologist has noted significant retinal vessel changes and expressed concerns about potential systemic implications, particularly regarding microvascular health and its potential systemic effects.\n\n#### Key Evidence and Reasoning\n\n1. **Impact of Congenital Heart Defect on Systemic Oxygenation:**\n   - **Congenital Heart Defects and ROP:** Congenital heart defects can lead to inconsistent oxygen delivery, which can affect retinal vascular development. The retina is highly sensitive to oxygen levels, and inadequate oxygenation can result in ROP.\n   - **Management Strategy:**\n     - **Correcting the Heart Defect:** If the congenital heart defect is correctable, surgical intervention should be considered to improve systemic oxygenation.\n     - **Supplemental Oxygen:** In the interim, supplemental oxygen can be used to optimize oxygen levels, but it should be carefully monitored to avoid hyperoxia, which can also be detrimental.\n     - **Collaboration with Ophthalmology:** Regular ophthalmologic follow-up is essential to monitor retinal changes and intervene with laser therapy or surgical interventions if necessary.\n\n2. **Systemic Implications of Concurrent Conditions:**\n   - **Poor Growth and Circulatory Efficiency:** Poor growth in a child with both retinal and cardiovascular disorders may be due to systemic circulatory inefficiencies. This can be exacerbated by underlying cardiovascular anomalies.\n   - **Multidisciplinary Approach:**\n     - **Cardiovascular Optimization:** Focus on optimizing cardiovascular function to improve circulation efficiency. This may include pharmacological interventions, lifestyle modifications, and, if necessary, surgical interventions.\n     - **Comprehensive Care:** Collaboration between cardiology, ophthalmology, and pediatrics is essential to address the interplay between circulatory efficiency and ocular vascular health.\n\n3. **Ongoing Retinal Issues and Cardiovascular Management:**\n   - **Visual Limitations and Treatment Adherence:** Retinal issues, such as impaired visual acuity or peripheral vision loss, can affect a patient's ability to understand and adhere to complex medical instructions.\n   - **Tailored Communication Strategies:**\n     - **Simplified Instructions:** Use clear and simple language to ensure the patient or caregiver fully understands the treatment plan.\n     - **Visual Aids and Educational Materials:** Provide visual aids and educational materials to enhance understanding and compliance.\n     - **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular check-ups to monitor both cardiovascular and retinal health, ensuring timely intervention if any complications arise.\n\n4. **Complications of Untreated ROP:**\n   - **Tractional Retinal Detachment:** Advanced ROP can lead to retinal traction and detachment, which can result in severe visual impairment or blindness.\n   - **Screening and Early Intervention:**\n     - **Regular Ophthalmic Screening:** Implement regular ophthalmic screening for premature infants to detect ROP early.\n     - **Timely Intervention:** Promptly intervene with laser photocoagulation or other treatments to prevent retinal detachment.\n\n### Evidence-Based Medical Analysis and Management Recommendations\n\n1. **Initial Assessment:**\n   - **Cardiovascular Examination:** Perform a thorough cardiovascular examination, including echocardiography, to assess the presence and severity of any congenital heart defects.\n   - **Ophthalmologic Evaluation:** Conduct a comprehensive ophthalmologic examination to assess the extent of retinal changes and determine the stage of ROP.\n\n2. **Management Plan:**\n   - **Correct Congenital Heart Defects:** If the heart defect is correctable, arrange for surgical intervention to improve systemic oxygenation.\n   - **Supplemental Oxygen Therapy:** Use supplemental oxygen cautiously to optimize oxygen levels, but monitor for hyperoxia.\n   - **Collaborative Care:** Establish a multidisciplinary care team including cardiology, ophthalmology, and pediatrics to coordinate treatment and monitoring.\n   - **Growth Monitoring:** Regularly monitor the child's growth and development to address any systemic circulatory inefficiencies.\n   - **Communication Strategies:** Use simplified instructions and visual aids to enhance treatment adherence, especially if the child has visual limitations.\n   - **Ophthalmic Screening:** Implement regular ophthalmic screening for premature infants to detect ROP early and intervene promptly.\n\n3. **Monitoring and Follow-ups:**\n   - **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-ups with both the cardiologist and ophthalmologist to monitor the child's cardiovascular and retinal health.\n   - **Adjustments to Treatment:** Be prepared to adjust the treatment plan based on the child's response to interventions and any new findings.\n\nBy following these evidence-based recommendations, the healthcare team can optimize the child's cardiovascular and retinal health, ensuring the best possible outcomes for the patient.", 'length': 5313, 'api_time': 89.44595098495483, 'timestamp': 1753351860.232497, 'error': False}

The ophthalmologist has noted significant retinal vessel changes and has expressed concerns regarding the child's cardiovascular health given the potential systemic implications of microvascular changes observed in ROP. As you assess the child, you consider possible cardiovascular complications that may arise. What cardiovascular assessments would be pertinent in this case, and how might the existing retinal findings influence your cardiovascular evaluation strategy, particularly concerning microvascular health and its potential systemic effects?\n\nPlease provide detailed medical analysis and recommendations.", 'response': "In this clinical case, a 6-year-old child with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) presents with significant retinal vessel changes, raising concerns about potential systemic implications. As a senior medical expert, I would recommend a comprehensive cardiovascular evaluation to assess for any underlying cardiovascular complications that may be related to the microvascular changes observed in the retina. Here is a detailed analysis and a recommended evaluation strategy:\n\n### 1. **Medical History and Physical Examination**\n- **Medical History:**\n  - **Perinatal History:** Obtain detailed information about the child's birth, including gestational age, birth weight, and any complications during delivery.\n  - **Family History:** Inquire about any cardiovascular or ocular diseases in the family.\n  - **Past Medical History:** Review any previous medical conditions, surgeries, or treatments.\n  - **Current Medications:** Document any medications the child is currently taking.\n- **Physical Examination:**\n  - **General Appearance:** Assess for signs of prematurity or other systemic conditions.\n  - **Cardiovascular Examination:**\n    - **Heart Sounds:** Auscultate for any murmurs, gallops, or rubs.\n    - **Peripheral Vascular Signs:** Check for signs of hypertension, such as brachial artery blood pressure differences, or signs of coarctation of the aorta.\n    - **Capillary Refill Time:** Evaluate for any signs of poor perfusion.\n\n### 2. **Cardiovascular Assessments**\nGiven the potential systemic implications of microvascular changes observed in ROP, the following cardiovascular assessments are pertinent:\n\n#### **A. Blood Pressure Measurement**\n- **Non-Invasive Measurement:** Measure blood pressure in both arms to detect any differences that might suggest coarctation of the aorta.\n- **Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM):** Consider this if there are any signs of hypertension or if the child is symptomatic.\n\n#### **B. Echocardiography**\n- **Echocardiogram:** This is the gold standard for evaluating cardiac structure and function. It can help identify any congenital heart defects, valvular abnormalities, or other structural heart issues that might be related to the microvascular changes.\n- **Fetal Echocardiography:** If the child was born prematurely, a fetal echocardiogram might have been performed, which could provide additional information.\n\n#### **C. Cardiac MRI or CT**\n- **Imaging Studies:** If there are specific concerns about complex cardiac anatomy or if echocardiography is inconclusive, cardiac MRI or CT can provide detailed images of the heart and great vessels.\n\n#### **D. Cardiovascular Risk Factors**\n- **Fasting Lipid Profile:** Assess for dyslipidemia, which can be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.\n- **Fasting Blood Glucose:** Evaluate for diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance, which can also contribute to cardiovascular risk.\n- **Anthropometric Measurements:** Measure height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) to assess for obesity, which is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease.\n\n### 3. **Ophthalmologic and Microvascular Health Considerations**\n- **Retinal Changes:** The significant retinal vessel changes in ROP suggest microvascular abnormalities. These changes are often associated with systemic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and other vascular disorders.\n- **Systemic Evaluation:** Given the systemic implications, a thorough evaluation for other microvascular diseases should be considered, including:\n  - **Fundoscopy:** Regular follow-up fundoscopy to monitor for progression of ROP.\n  - **Retinal Vessel Fluorescein Angiography:** To assess the integrity of the retinal vasculature and identify any areas of leakage or ischemia.\n  - **Systemic Blood Pressure Monitoring:** Regular monitoring of blood pressure to detect any hypertension.\n  - **Glucose Tolerance Testing:** To screen for diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance.\n\n### 4. **Recommendations**\n- **Referral to a Pediatric Cardiologist:** Given the potential systemic implications, it is crucial to refer the child to a pediatric cardiologist for a comprehensive cardiovascular evaluation.\n- **Regular Follow-Up:** Schedule regular follow-up visits to monitor the child's cardiovascular health and retinal status.\n- **Lifestyle Modifications:** If any risk factors are identified, implement lifestyle modifications such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, and weight management.\n- **Genetic Counseling:** Consider genetic counseling if there is a family history of cardiovascular or ocular diseases.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe microvascular changes observed in ROP suggest a potential systemic vascular disease. A comprehensive cardiovascular evaluation, including echocardiography, blood pressure monitoring, and other relevant tests, is essential to identify any underlying cardiovascular complications. Regular follow-up and monitoring are crucial to ensure early detection and management of any potential issues.", 'length': 4977, 'api_time': 92.66847014427185, 'timestamp': 1753351863.4531698, 'error': False}

**Case Analysis**:
In this case, the baseline model (Answer B) provided a conventional, standard clinical evaluation process, covering history taking, physical examination, and various cardiac tests. However, its response failed to delve into the intrinsic pathophysiological connection between ROP and the cardiovascular system.

In contrast, the MemCube-enhanced model (Answer A) demonstrated a higher level of clinical reasoning ability. It was able to invoke and integrate multiple related knowledge fragments (these knowledge pieces were distilled into QA memories for concepts such as “ROP,” “congenital heart disease,” and “systemic oxygenation”), for example:

* Explicitly pointed out that “congenital heart disease may lead to unstable oxygen delivery, thereby affecting retinal vascular development.”
* Emphasized the potential benefits of optimizing “systemic circulation efficiency” for improving ocular vascular health and overall development.

This reflects the core advantage of MemCube: it is not merely simple information retrieval, but rather the effective association of discrete knowledge points during reasoning, forming a multi-perspective, more in-depth analytical framework. This allows the enhanced model to approach problems like a senior expert—exploring issues from an etiological level and proposing interdisciplinary, integrated management strategies, rather than merely listing examination items.

The presence of arrhythmias in IDC is common and can exacerbate symptoms such as palpitations and dizziness, potentially leading to more severe complications like syncope or sudden cardiac death.\n\n#### Diagnostic Approach\n1. **Electrocardiogram (ECG) Monitoring:**\n   - **Initial ECG:** To identify any immediate arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, or frequent premature beats.\n   - **Holter Monitoring:** For 24-48 hours to capture intermittent arrhythmias.\n   - **Event Monitor:** For patients with infrequent symptoms, to record arrhythmias as they occur.\n   - **Implantable Loop Recorder:** For patients with recurrent symptoms and negative initial monitoring.\n\n2. **Echocardiography:**\n   - To assess ventricular function, chamber dimensions, and wall motion abnormalities.\n   - To evaluate for any thrombus formation, which could be a source of embolic events.\n\n3. **Blood Tests:**\n   - Cardiac biomarkers (e.g., BNP, NT-proBNP) to assess heart failure severity.\n   - Thyroid function tests, as hyperthyroidism can cause palpitations.\n   - Electrolyte levels, particularly potassium and magnesium, which can affect cardiac rhythm.\n\n#### Therapeutic Approach\n1. **Optimization of Heart Failure Therapy:**\n   - **Beta-Blockers:** Proven to reduce mortality and hospitalization in IDC. They also stabilize the heart rhythm, reducing the risk of arrhythmias.\n   - **ACE Inhibitors/ARBs:** To reduce afterload and improve ventricular function.\n   - **Diuretics:** To manage fluid overload and alleviate symptoms of heart failure.\n   - **SGLT2 Inhibitors:** Emerging evidence supports their use in reducing cardiovascular events in heart failure patients.\n\n2. **Antiarrhythmic Therapy:**\n   - **Class I Antiarrhythmics (e.g., flecainide, propafenone):** Used cautiously due to potential proarrhythmic effects.\n   - **Class III Antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol):** Amiodarone is effective but has significant side effects; sotalol is a beta-blocker with antiarrhythmic properties.\n   - **Calcium Channel Blockers (e.g., verapamil, diltiazem):** Useful for certain arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation, but use with caution due to negative inotropic effects.\n\n3. **Device Therapy:**\n   - **Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD):** Indicated in patients with IDC and reduced ejection fraction (EF <35%) to prevent sudden cardiac death.\n   - **Pacemakers:** Considered in patients with bradyarrhythmias or those requiring resynchronization therapy (CRT).\n\n4. **Lifestyle Modifications:**\n   - Smoking cessation, alcohol moderation, and a low-sodium diet.\n   - Regular, moderate-intensity exercise as tolerated.\n   - Stress management techniques to reduce arrhythmia triggers.\n\n#### Proarrhythmic Risk and Management\n- **Proarrhythmic Potential:** Antiarrhythmic drugs can paradoxically increase the risk of arrhythmias, particularly in patients with structural heart disease. Careful selection and monitoring are essential.\n- **Risk Stratification:** Use risk stratification tools like the CHA2DS2-VASc score for thromboembolic risk and the European Society of Cardiology guidelines for ICD implantation.\n\n#### Conclusion\nIn managing a patient with IDC and arrhythmias, a comprehensive approach is necessary, combining optimal heart failure therapy with targeted antiarrhythmic treatment and device therapy as indicated.

How does the presence of arrhythmias influence your diagnostic and therapeutic approach, especially in the context of managing dilated cardiomyopathy?\n\nPlease provide detailed medical analysis and recommendations.', 'response': "In the context of an adult patient with known idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) presenting with palpitations and dizziness, the presence of arrhythmias significantly influences the diagnostic and therapeutic approach. Here is a detailed analysis and recommendations based on current medical practices:\n\n### Clinical Context and Initial Assessment\n- **Idiopathic Dilated Cardiomyopathy**: DCM is characterized by ventricular dilation and impaired systolic function, often leading to heart failure and arrhythmias.\n- **Symptoms**: Palpitations and dizziness are common symptoms that can be indicative of arrhythmias, which are frequent complications in DCM.\n- **Risk Factors**: The patient's history of DCM places them at higher risk for arrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation (AF), ventricular tachycardia (VT), and bradyarrhythmias.\n\n### Diagnostic Approach\n1. **History and Physical Examination**: Detailed history to understand the onset, duration, and triggers of palpitations and dizziness. Physical examination should focus on signs of heart failure, such as jugular venous distension, rales, and peripheral edema.\n2. **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: Essential for detecting arrhythmias. Can identify AF, VT, or other conduction abnormalities.\n3. **Holter Monitoring**: Useful for patients with intermittent symptoms to capture arrhythmias that may not be evident on a standard ECG.\n4. **Echocardiography**: To assess ventricular function, size, and potential thrombus formation, especially if AF is suspected.\n5. **Cardiac MRI**: Provides detailed images of the heart structure and function, which can be crucial in assessing the extent of DCM and ruling out other causes of cardiomyopathy.\n6. **Blood Tests**: Including electrolytes, thyroid function tests, and markers of heart failure (BNP/NT-proBNP).\n\n### Therapeutic Approach\n1. **Management of Arrhythmias**:\n   - **Atrial Fibrillation**: If diagnosed, rate control or rhythm control strategies should be considered. Rate control can be achieved with beta-blockers or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. Rhythm control might involve antiarrhythmic drugs or catheter ablation.\n   - **Ventricular Tachycardia**: If VT is suspected or confirmed, antiarrhythmic drugs (e.g., amiodarone) or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) may be necessary. Catheter ablation can also be considered.\n   - **Bradyarrhythmias**: If bradyarrhythmias are present, a pacemaker may be indicated.\n\n2. **Management of Dilated Cardiomyopathy**:\n   - **Heart Failure Medications**: Continue or initiate medications such as ACE inhibitors/ARBs, beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists, and diuretics as needed.\n   - **Lifestyle Modifications**: Encourage a heart-healthy diet, regular physical activity, and smoking cessation.\n   - **Monitoring**: Regular follow-up with echocardiography and clinical assessment to monitor disease progression and response to therapy.\n\n3. **Anticoagulation**:\n   - If AF is present, anticoagulation therapy is necessary to prevent thromboembolic events. The choice of anticoagulant (e.g., warfarin, direct oral anticoagulants) should be based on the patient's risk factors and comorbidities.\n\n### Prognosis and Long-Term Management\n- **Prognosis**: The presence of arrhythmias in DCM can worsen prognosis. Regular monitoring and timely intervention are crucial.\n- **Long-Term Management**: Focus on preventing arrhythmias and heart failure exacerbations. Consider multidisciplinary care involving cardiologists, electrophysiologists, and heart failure specialists.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe presence of arrhythmias in a patient with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy requires a comprehensive approach, including thorough diagnostic evaluation and tailored therapeutic interventions.

**Case Analysis**:
The base 32B model is already able to provide a fairly comprehensive and accurate response, covering diagnostic procedures, treatment plans, and prognostic management.

However, the MemCube-enhanced model excels further in terms of **structure, logic, and depth of detail**. By retrieving and integrating QA memories in MemCube related to concepts such as “DCM,” “arrhythmia,” and “proarrhythmic risk,” Answer A demonstrates the following characteristics:

* **Clearer logical hierarchy**: Answer A categorizes diagnostic and treatment methods, such as explaining antiarrhythmic drugs by class (Class I, Class III, etc.) and explicitly pointing out precautions when using them in the context of DCM (e.g., proarrhythmic risk).
* **Key knowledge points highlighted**: Answer A clearly identifies “optimized heart failure therapy” as the foundation for managing arrhythmias and lists drugs such as β-blockers, noting their dual role in stabilizing heart rhythm. These originate from QA memories in MemCube that emphasize critical points in clinical practice.
* **Stronger risk awareness**: Answer A includes a dedicated section on “Proarrhythmic Risk and Management,” showing that the model is not only stating knowledge but also imitating an expert’s risk assessment mindset.

This case demonstrates that even for a powerful 32B model, MemCube can still serve as a “knowledge coach,” helping the model organize and express its vast internal knowledge in a more structured and clinically logical manner, thereby providing more instructive and professional guidance.
